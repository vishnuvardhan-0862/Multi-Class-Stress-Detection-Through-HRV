# Multi-Class-Stress-Detection-Through-HRV
Multi-Class Stress Detection

A Django-based web application for detecting and classifying stress levels using machine learning. The project provides a backend system that integrates ML models with Django’s powerful framework, enabling multi-class stress classification.

🚀 Features

🔹 Multi-class stress detection using ML models.

🔹 Django-powered backend for scalability and maintainability.

🔹 REST API endpoints for predictions and data handling.

🔹 Database support (SQLite by default, easily configurable to PostgreSQL/MySQL).

🔹 Modular structure for better readability and extension.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Django

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your model)

Database: SQLite (default), can be extended to PostgreSQL/MySQL

Frontend (optional): Django templates or can be integrated with React/Angular

📊 Usage

Upload or input data for stress detection.

The ML model will classify the input into different stress categories.

Use REST API endpoints for integration with other systems.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add real-time data analysis (e.g., from wearable devices).

Build a frontend dashboard for visualization.

Extend ML model with deep learning approaches.
